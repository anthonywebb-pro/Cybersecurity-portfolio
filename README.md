”A portfolio for showcasing my progress and achievements in cybersecurity.”

ABOUT ME:
Name: Anthony Webb
Hometown: Atlanta Georgia
Prior IT Experience: I am new to the IT field. I am interested in cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligent advancements. 

Career Plans: I want to work in cybersecurity as analyst and eventually becoming a pen tester for both software and hardware.

Proud Project/Task: I recently finished an intense automotive course in which I am very proud of because I knew nothing of the inner workings of automobiles, but after the course I have grown a deep respect for the engineering genuis of those that have created a technological entity that is nothing short of "masterful craftmanship."
